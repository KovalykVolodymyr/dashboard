# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### /app

This is the main project folder. It contains the following files and folders:

- \services - This folder contains the simulates an API code including static calls.
- \_hooks - This folder contains the custom hooks.
- \_styles - This folder contains the global styles .
- \_types - This folder contains the typescript global types that can be used across different parts of the application.
- \_utils - This folder contains the helper global functions.
- \_components - This folder contains the components which are overused.
- \_assets - This folder contains the images/icons.
- \_layouts - This folder contains the DefaultLayout.
- \_layouts - This folder contains the DefaultLayout.
- \_modules- This folder contains the modules with whole logic which routers use .
- \_routes - This folder contains the routes for the application and each file is used to get date for a page.
- \_tests - This folder contains unit tests for critical components or functions.

### /public

This folder contains the public files like images, fonts, meta fiels, etc.

### .eslintrc.json & .eslintignore

ESLint files to lint the code and point out potential errors or best practices.

### .prettierrc & .prettierignore

Prettier files to format the code in propper way to keep the same code style across the project.

### .gitignore

Git ignore file to ignore the files that should not be pushed to the repository.

### Why I use other packages

- Sass simplifies and enhances CSS by offering features like variables, nesting, and mixins, promoting cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets in web development.

- React-Toastify provides a convenient and customizable solution for displaying non-intrusive toast notifications in React applications, enhancing user experience with informative messages.

- Jest is a powerful and developer-friendly JavaScript testing framework that simplifies unit testing, providing a comprehensive suite for testing React applications and ensuring code reliability.
